# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical code quality, performance, and maintainability issues identified in the OPC UA Dashboard application. The improvements focus on fixing immediate compile/runtime errors, removing duplicate code, enhancing security, and establishing proper development practices to ensure long-term maintainability and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Immediate Compile/Runtime Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve all compile and runtime errors so that the application builds and runs without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript configuration is processed THEN the system SHALL remove the invalid "noFallthrough" compiler option
2. WHEN duplicate utility files are detected THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single source of truth
3. WHEN console.log statements are found in production code THEN the system SHALL remove or replace them with proper logging
4. WHEN alert() functions are used THEN the system SHALL replace them with proper toast notifications
5. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL complete without TypeScript or ESLint errors

### Requirement 2: Implement Comprehensive Form Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper form validation with clear feedback so that I can successfully submit forms without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters invalid data in any form THEN the system SHALL display real-time validation feedback
2. WHEN a user submits a form with invalid data THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and highlight errors
3. WHEN validating IP addresses in machine dialogs THEN the system SHALL use proper IP validation patterns
4. WHEN form validation occurs THEN the system SHALL provide accessible error messages
5. WHEN forms are in loading states THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators

### Requirement 3: Enhance Application Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust security measures implemented so that user data and application integrity are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input is processed THEN the system SHALL sanitize all inputs to prevent XSS attacks
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL include proper CSRF protection
3. WHEN passwords are created THEN the system SHALL enforce strong password requirements
4. WHEN sensitive data is handled THEN the system SHALL never log or expose it in console outputs
5. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate response structure and content

### Requirement 4: Optimize Application Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and responsive application performance so that I can efficiently monitor and manage industrial systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large components render THEN the system SHALL use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. WHEN expensive calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL use useMemo for optimization
3. WHEN large data tables are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement virtualization
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement AbortController for cleanup
5. WHEN charts are rendered THEN the system SHALL optimize rendering with proper memoization

### Requirement 5: Improve Application Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the application to be fully accessible so that I can use all features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN the system SHALL include proper ARIA labels
2. WHEN users navigate with keyboard THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation
3. WHEN dialogs are opened THEN the system SHALL implement proper focus management
4. WHEN color is used to convey information THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG contrast requirements
5. WHEN data visualizations are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide screen reader support

### Requirement 6: Establish Proper Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and helpful error messages so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in components THEN the system SHALL use error boundaries to gracefully handle them
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate retry mechanisms
4. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL use structured logging instead of console statements
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide recovery options to users

### Requirement 7: Standardize Code Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code architecture and patterns so that the codebase is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large components exceed 300 lines THEN the system SHALL break them into smaller, focused components
2. WHEN utility functions are needed THEN the system SHALL use a single, centralized utils file
3. WHEN imports are used THEN the system SHALL consistently use alias imports (@/ pattern)
4. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL follow consistent folder structure patterns
5. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN the system SHALL have proper type definitions or remove TS config entirely
